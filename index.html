    <h2 tabindex="10">What is a Treaty?</h2>   

<p tabindex="11">Treaties are official agreements between countries or groups.
    Indigenous people in Canada have been making treaties for a very long time using storytelling,
    wampum belts, and many other forms of communication in order to create a document and maintain agreements.
    For many Indigenous Peoples, treaties are sacred and binding agreements more so than legal rights.</p>

<h2 tabindex="16"> Treaty 1</h2>  

<p tabindex="17"> Treaty 1 was signed in<span class="highlighted-text"> 1871</span>
    between the Canadian government and seven different First Nations. It was negotiated in Lower Fort Garry in Manitoba
    , Canada. The seven First Nations that were involved in Treaty 1 are Long Plain First Nation, Peguis First Nation,
    Sagkeeng First Nation, Brokenhead Ojibway Nation, Roseau River Anishinaabe First Nation, Sandy Bay Ojibway First Nation,
    and Swan Lake First Nation.</p>  

<p tabindex="18">Treaty 1 allowed the government to use lands in southern Manitoba for settlement. In exchange,
    Indigenous people were promised reserve lands, annual payments, and schools to support education. However,
    some of these promises were not fulfilled.</p>

<h2 tabindex="23">How It's Implemented Today</h2>  


<div class="content-box">  

<p tabindex="24">Treaty 1 is being implemented today through urban reserves and business developments that are profitable
    for First Nations. Naawi-Oodena is developing into a community of residences and businesses.
    Long Plain First Nation has urban reserves with gas stations and offices. These developments create jobs.</p>  


<p tabindex="25"> Treaty 1 is <span class="highlighted-text">still active today</span>, the treaty has not been fully honored, leading to harm against Indigenous Peoples through residential schools, discrimination, and intergenerational trauma. In 2023, RRC Polytech raised the Treaty One flag, along with the Red River MÃ©tis and Inclusive Pride flags, to recognize the land's original inhabitants.</p>
